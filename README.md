Kaggle projects portfolio

This project was done using Python language with MatPlotLib, Pandas and Numpy libraries.

It is a basic project, I tried to better understand the features and some information in 
a basic way.

I used the Pareto principle to understand what percentage of customers really made a difference 
in the business and time series to understand how sales occurred over time.

Hope you enjoy.
